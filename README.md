# Potato_Chatbot

This is my project for COGS 18.

This is a chatbot which gives advice on what to do based on the user's mood, however it is more helpful if the user is feeling down. It will also end the chat when it can no longer help the user.

-If they are feeling sad and someone is in danger, it will give a list of numbers they can call. -If they are bored, it will ask them to do something that makes them happy during their free time. -Lastly, if they are happy, it will ask them what made them feel that way.

I had friends both in the class, and out of the class to talk to my chatbot and noticed that when they would reply to the questions, they would answer with either just 'yes' or 'no'. I wanted to fix this issue, but I found it difficult since my chatbot would ask multiple yes or no questions. Since I could use if, elif, and else statements my chatbot doesn't understand just 'yes' or 'no' answers, and the user has to be more specific when answering the questions.
