    "I had friends both in the class, and out of the class to talk to my chatbot and noticed that when they would reply to the questions, they would answer with either just 'yes' or 'no'. I wanted to fix this issue, but I found it difficult since my chatbot would ask multiple yes or no questions. Since I could use if, elif, and else statements my chatbot doesn't understand just 'yes' or 'no' answers, and the user has to be more specific when answering the questions."
